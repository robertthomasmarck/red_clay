## Organic Growth

Unlike wheel-thrown pieces, these vessels were built using coil and slab techniques, allowing for asymmetry and organic imperfections. The inspiration comes from the eroded cliffs and stone formations of the coast.

Each piece is unique, with textures created by pressing local stones and shells into the soft clay before firing.
