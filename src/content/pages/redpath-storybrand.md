### Character: The Hero

- **Who is the hero?** - The hero is the therapist. Who is also a guide.
- **What does the hero want?** - To give their clients the tools they need to win and overcome their pain and struggle. And to win the day. To not spend time on anything except client success. To streamline their advertising so they don't have to think about it.

### Problem: The Villain

- **Who or what is the villain?** - A website that doesn't do it's job. It's job is to attract your _ideal_ client, and to filter out the people who aren't the right fit. You lose time because you get calls from people who won't benefit from your therapy, they lose time with a therapist who can't help them.
- **External Problem** - Time lost to a website that doesn't fit you, doesn't communicate what you do, and is a pain to work with.
- **Internal Problem** - The frustration from connecting to the wrong clients, and missing the clients that need you.
- **Philosophical Problem**
