# Landing Page Plan

## Header

_Hero banner: Does the header pass the grunt test?_

1. **What do you offer?** - Websites designed for therapists
2. **How will it make the customer's life better?** - Make it easier for therapists to connect with their ideal clients.
3. **What does the customer need to do to buy it?** - Contact me Today! or Go to the site to read blog and subscribe

**Offer Statement:** Websites for Therapists: Created to connect you with your ideal client.

## Stakes

- **What is the cost of not doing business with me?**
  The ideal client passing you up.
  Time wasted with clients who aren't the right fit.
  Are your best clients passing you up for a bad website.
  Does your website fail to connect you to the people that need you?
  Do the people who need you knwo what you have to offer?

**Stakes Statement:** Reaching potential clients is tough
Your website is your first chance a client has to get to know you. Within a few seconds they've decided whether or not they want to stay and get to know you, or move on. Sometimes a potential client gets the wrong impression about what you offer, and you don't find out until session 6 that they're not the right fit.

**Imagine:**
Sarah lands on your front page. Your help is exactly what she needs... but moments later she clicks away: it just doesn't feel right.

**Imagine:**
John and Emma are looking for a traditional couples therapist. When they land on your site they don't find anything that tells them that you use a lot of play in your work. They quit on the third session because you suggested they talk about their issues while they build something with Lego.

Both sites have the same problem: They don't connect with your clients.

Your clients are looking for you, can they find you?

## Value Proposition

- With a website designed by Red Path, you'll

1. Connect with your ideal client the moment they land on your website. They will know who you are and what you offer.
2. You'll save time because the clients you can't help will know you can't help them.
3. You'll filter out the clients who aren't looking for what you offer.
4. You'll save time because you don't have to spend weeks learning a website publishing platform.
5. You'll avoid the frustration of buildling and managing a complex technical product.
6. Instead of worrying that your website attracting clients, you'll be able to focus on what you do best: help people.
7. You'll feel like your website represents **you**.
