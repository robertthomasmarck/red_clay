## The Hands Behind the Clay

I am a ceramic artist based in the Pacific Northwest, where the rugged coastline and dense forests inspire my work. My journey with clay began over a decade ago, first as a meditative practice and later as a lifelong obsession with form and fire.

I work primarily with stoneware and porcelain, utilizing both wheel-throwing and hand-building techniques. My philosophy is rooted in wabi-sabi—finding beauty in the imperfect, the impermanent, and the incomplete.

### Process & Materials

Every piece is crafted in my home studio. I formulate my own glazes using locally sourced ash and minerals, resulting in surfaces that are unique to my environment. The firing process is a collaboration with the kiln; I can guide the heat, but the flame has the final say.

When I am not in the studio, you can find me hiking the trails of the Cascades or scouring the beach for interesting stones and driftwood.
