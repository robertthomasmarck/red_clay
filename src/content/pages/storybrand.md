### Character: The Hero

- **Who is the hero?** - The hero is the therapist. Who is also a guide.
- **What does the hero want?** - To give their clients the tools they need to win and overcome their pain and struggle. And to win the day. To not spend time on anything except client success. To streamline their advertising so they don't have to think about it.

### Problem: The Villain

- **Who or what is the villain?** - A website that doesn't do it's job. It's job is to attract your _ideal_ client, and to filter out the people who aren't the right fit. You lose time because you get calls from people who won't benefit from your therapy, they lose time with a therapist who can't help them.
- **External Problem** - Time lost to a website that doesn't fit you, doesn't communicate what you do, and is a pain to work with.
- **Internal Problem** - The frustration from connecting to the wrong clients, and missing the clients that need you.
- **Philosophical Problem** - Every therapist deserves a website that helps them do their job; that helps them connect and communicate with their ideal client.

### Guide: Red Path Design

- **Competency** - Testimonials & Portfolio
- **Empathic Statement** - I know how it feels to be paired up with the wrong therapist. The right client is looking for you, and you're looking for the right client. I've been to therapists where I can tell that they know they're not the right person for me. It's frustrating for both of us.

### Plan

1. Send me a note (contact me)
2. We'll schedule a call
3. I'll get started

### Call to Action

- **Direct Call to Action** - Contact Me Today
- **Transitional Calls to Action** - No Thanks: Take me to The Website and Subscribe Today

### Avoid Failure - Negative Consequences

- **Wasted Time:** For Your Client and for You
- **Missed Opportunity:** Your ideal client might not even know how good a match you are.
- **Low Quality Clients:** Clients who can't pay, won't respond to your help, and will quit when things get hard.

### Character Triumph

- **What Does Success Look Like?** Graduating more clients without ever worrying about where the next one will come from.

### Character Transformation

- **Who will you become?** - You go from a frustrated therapist who can't seem to find the kind of client you want to help, to the kind of therapist who is graduating clients all time because you find the perfect match: the clients who will respond to your unique brand of help, but without worrying about where your next client is going to come from because you have a waiting list of people who want to work with you.

### Controlling Idea/Theme/Uniqueness

- **Connection/Empathy** - Your website is an expression of empathy. You are offering to guide someone from where they are now, to a place of peace, calm, and safety. Victimhood to triumph. That path can be hard and difficult. Your website can be the first bit of hope someone has felt in a long time. That's why I focus on empathy and connection.
